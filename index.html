            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Established by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations (UN) in 1958 as one of the UN's five regional commissions, ECA's mandate is to promote the economic and social development of its member States, foster intra-regional integration, and promote international cooperation for Africa's development.</p>
                       <p>
                ECA is headed by an  Executive Secretary, who is assisted by a Deputy Executive Secretary. Its work programme is supported by two pillars: policy research and knowledge delivery. There are five substantive divisions responsible for policy research: Macroeconomic Policy, Regional Integration & Trade, Social Policy Development, Special Initiatives, and the African Centre for Statistics. The Capacity Development Division, IDEP (ECA’s training arm), the Division of Administration and ECA’s Subregional Offices in Rabat, Niamey, Yaounde, Kigali and Lusaka comprise the Knowledge Delivery pillar. Knowledge generation and knowledge delivery at ECA are underpinned by the Strategic Planning & Operational Quality Division and the Public Information and Knowledge Management Division.  The ECA Partnerships Office and the Joint Secretariat Support Office of the ECA, AUC and AfDB complement the work of the substantive Divisions.

            <h1>Addis Ababa to host 'Beijing +20' Regional Conference</h1>
<p>Addis Ababa, 15 November 2014 (ECA) - Over a hundred and fifty delegates, technical experts and governments, from across the African continent will gather in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 17-19 November 2014 to reflect on 20 years of the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA) since its adoption at the International Conference in 1995 in Beijing, China. Running over three days, the Conference coincides with the ongoing global debates around the Post-2015 development agenda and regional conversations around Agenda 2063, shaping Africa’s development for the next 50 years.
</p><p>
    Organized by UN Women and the Economic Commission for Africa, the main objective of the conference is to provide Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and African member States with an opportunity to review the accomplishments, as well as garner consensus, in addressing challenges affecting achievement of gender equality and women’s empowerment nationally and in the region as a whole.
</p>
    “This conference offers delegates an opportunity to debate on topical issues in Africa and globally and how they impact the gender equality agenda and the advancement of women and girls rights,” said Thokozile Rudvidzo, Coordinator of the ECA African Center for Gender.</p>
